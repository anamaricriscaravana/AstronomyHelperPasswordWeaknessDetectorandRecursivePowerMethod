# Astronomy Helper, Password WeaknessDetector, and Recursive Power Method

This project is developed for a Programming Logic and Design subject, that involves creating programs in Java, Python, and C++ to solve specific problems. The exercises focus on applying fundamental programming concepts such as menus, string handling, and recursion.

# Problems
1. Astronomy Helper
- Description: Create an application that displays a menu allowing the user to select a planet. When a planet is selected, the program displays data about the planet’s average distance from the sun, mass, and surface temperature.
- Data:
<br/> **Mercury:** 57.9 million km, 3.31 × 10^23 kg, -173 to 430°C
<br/> **Venus:** 108.2 million km, 4.87 × 10^24 kg, 472°C
<br/> **Earth:** 149.6 million km, 5.967 × 10^24 kg, -50 to 50°C
<br/> **Mars:** 227.9 million km, 0.6424 × 10^24 kg, -140 to 20°C

2. Password Weakness Detector
- Description: Design a program that asks the user to enter a password, and then analyzes it for various weaknesses, such as length, character types, and sequences. The program should display messages indicating whether any weaknesses are found in the password.
- Weaknesses:
  <br/> Fewer than 8 characters
  <br/> No uppercase or no lowercase letters
  <br/> No numeric digit
  <br/> No special character
  <br/> Consecutive uppercase, lowercase, or numeric sequences
  <br/> Repeating sequence of characters

3. Recursive Power Method
- Description: Design a function that uses recursion to raise a number to a power. The function accepts two arguments: the base number and the exponent (nonnegative integer).
- Formula: power(base, exp) = base^exp
